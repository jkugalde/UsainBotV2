UsainBotV2 is the second version of the line follower robot made by the staff of Fablab U de Chile. The goal of the project is to use it as a platform to teach robotics to the students at the Faculty of Engineering at the Universidad de Chile, so they can make their own robot and compete in the national tournament. A fun way to get involve in robotics at an early stage.
